                The chickens that saved Western civilization were discovered, according to legend, by the side of 
                 a road in Greece in the first decade of the fifth century B.C. The Athenian general Themistocles, 
                 on his way to confront the invading Persian forces, stopped to watch two cocks fighting and summoned 
                 his troops, saying: “Behold, these do not fight for their household gods, for the monuments of their 
                 ancestors, for glory, for liberty or the safety of their children, but only because one will not give
                 way to the other.” The tale does not describe what happened to the loser, nor explain why the soldiers 
                 found this display of instinctive aggression inspirational rather than pointless and depressing. But
                 history records that the Greeks, thus heartened, went on to repel the invaders, preserving the 
                 civilization that today honors those same creatures by breading, frying and dipping them into one’s 
                 choice of sauce. The descendants of those roosters might well think—if they were capable of such 
                 profound thought—that their ancient forebears have a lot to answer for.
                 Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries with ease. With its 
                 mild taste and uniform texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for the flavor palette of 
                 almost any cuisine. A generation of Britons is coming of age in the belief that chicken tikka masala is 
                 the national dish, and the same thing is happening in China with Kentucky Fried Chicken. Long after the 
                 time when most families had a few hens running around the yard that could be grabbed and turned into 
                 dinner, chicken remains a nostalgic, evocative dish for most Americans. When author Jack Canfield was 
                 looking for a metaphor for psychological comfort, he didn’t call it “Clam Chowder for the Soul.”
